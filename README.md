#Django Web Application Project:
This repository contains a Django web application built with Python.
The project implements basic authentication functionality, 
including user registration, login, and logout, with secure.
And insecure versions of the code for demonstration purposes.

##Django Project Files:
views.py: Contains the core logic for user authentication (vulnerable and secure versions).
urls.py: Configures the URLs for the web application.
home.html, register.html, login.html: Templates for rendering pages.

###Vulnerable Code Demonstration:
Missing input validation
Lack of strong password criteria
Session security weaknesses
Insecure handling of user authentication

####Secure Code Implementation:
The secure version of views.py addresses the vulnerabilities in the following ways:

Adds input validation and error handling.
Implements strong password policies.
Enhances session security by setting session expiration policies.

#####Tools for Security Analysis:
Manual Code Review: 
Review the code to identify vulnerabilities like weak input validation,
session handling issues, and lack of error handling.
